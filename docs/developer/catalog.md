# Catalog validation, versioning and evaluations

**Audience:** Developers, administrators. **Implementation status:** Partially Implemented.

**Prerequisites:** Read the platform overview and have access to the relevant organization or source checkout.

Architecture V2 Phase B. The catalog separates three layers:

```text
Global catalog definition      QA Engineer 1.1.0 (blueprint + pinned skills, tools, workflows)
        ↓ installed by an organization admin
Organization installation      "Checkout QA": Jira + Bitbucket + Playwright (org-wide answers)
        ↓ agent created for an employee
Agent instance + manifest      project, repository, QA URL (per-agent answers) → signed manifest
```

## Status

Implemented, meaning data model, validation, persistence, authorization, API, admin UI and tests:

- Declarative catalog definitions: blueprints, skills, tools and workflows (`packages/catalog`).
- Startup validation and registration into an immutable catalog of record, pinned by digest.
- Versioned catalog read API.
- Organization installations: create, update, retire, admin panel, and change events.
- Admin agent creation from an installation.
- A generic manifest resolver with no role-specific code (ADR 0009).
- Governance evaluation suites for every role, run by a generic runner through the real
  platform ([ADR 0019](../adr/0019-role-evaluation-suites.md)).
- Model-quality tasks for every role, worked by a real model on request and graded by checks
  and a grader model, within budgets ([ADR 0020](../adr/0020-model-quality-evaluations.md)).

Not implemented yet:

- Loading role packages from external repositories.
- A catalog publishing and promotion workflow.
- Per-employee agent editing or re-issuing.
- An executable Skill Runtime beyond prompting. Registered tools now include artifact, issue-tracker, source-control and execution-backed repository/browser/edit/build/dependency tools; availability is narrowed by the manifest and runtime configuration.
- Editing installations in the UI. Updates are API-only: `PUT /api/organization/agent-installations/:id`.

## Definitions

All shapes are in `packages/contracts/src/catalog.ts`. Strict schemas are in `catalog-schemas.ts`,
so role-package repositories can validate against the same contract.

| Suite     | `id`, `blueprintId`, `world` (issues, repositories, checkout files), `scenarios[]` of answers, task, scripted tool calls with expected results and approvals, offered tools, final run status, executed actions (ADR 0019)                                                             |
| Blueprint | Identity, persona, runtime, model profile, pinned skill/tool/workflow versions, connector requirements with answer→provider mappings, conditional MCP, memory, knowledge, `policy.actions`, evaluation suite, and a questionnaire whose questions are scoped `INSTALLATION` or `AGENT` |

Blueprints list the **actions** a role may ever request. The **outcome** of each action
(`ALLOW`, `REQUIRE_APPROVAL` or `DENY`) always comes from the policy engine at resolution time,
never from catalog data. A catalog can't grant itself permission.

## Validation (fails the whole catalog)

`resolveCatalog` rejects a catalog if any of these is true:

- A definition fails its schema. Unknown fields are rejected too.
- A version is a duplicate.
- A blueprint references a skill, tool or workflow version that doesn't exist.
- A skill needs a tool or connector capability the blueprint doesn't declare.
- A workflow step uses a skill or action the blueprint doesn't declare.
- A policy action is unknown to the policy engine.
- A connector mapping doesn't cover every option of its question.
- An MCP condition references an option that doesn't exist.
- A role version names a missing evaluation suite, or another role's suite; a suite is unused.
- A scenario uses a workflow its version doesn't have, answers unknown questions or omits
  required ones, calls an unknown tool, or expects an unknown action.
- A quality task does the same, approves an unknown action, or checks an unknown tool or
  action.

Evaluation suites are validated with the catalog but are not part of bundle digests, so adding
or improving evaluations never changes a released role version.

The API does not start with an invalid catalog.

## Catalog of record and version pinning (ADR 0010)

On startup each blueprint version is resolved into a bundle: the blueprint plus the exact
skill, tool and workflow definitions it pins. The bundle is hashed with SHA-256 over canonical
JSON and stored in `catalog_blueprint_versions`, which is immutable (update and delete are
blocked by triggers).

- If a shipped version's content no longer matches its registered digest, startup fails with
  `CATALOG_VERSION_MUTATED`. Change content only by adding a new version.
- Registered versions stay resolvable after they stop shipping, so installations and agents
  that reference them keep working.
- Installations and v2 manifests record the digest (`metadata.blueprint.digest`).
- A version registered by another instance is loaded when its registration is notified, and
  read from the database if it is needed first. See
  [ADR 0029](../adr/0029-catalog-version-reload.md).
- Every stored bundle records its structure (`bundle_schema`, currently
  `agents-foundry.catalog-bundle/v1`) and is served only if this release implements that
  schema and the bundle passes the current strict schemas, its digest, its stored id and
  version, exact pinning and the consistency rules. Otherwise it fails with
  `BLUEPRINT_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED`. See [ADR 0030](../adr/0030-catalog-bundle-compatibility.md).

## Installations

`organization_agent_installations` is tenant-scoped. An installation holds validated answers
to the blueprint's `INSTALLATION`-scoped questions. An agent created from it supplies only
`AGENT`-scoped answers. Sending an installation-scoped answer is rejected, so employees' agents
cannot diverge from organization settings.

| `/`                                                 | POST   | `{ name, blueprintId, blueprintVersion, configuration }`          |
| `/:id`                                              | PUT    | `{ name, blueprintVersion, configuration, version }` (optimistic) |
| `/:id/retire`                                       | POST   | `{ version }`; retirement is final                                |

- Password-mode organization admins only, rechecked against live identity records.
- The tenant comes from the session, and unknown fields (including `organizationId`) are
  rejected. Other tenants' installations return 404.
- Active names are unique per organization, case-insensitive.
- Changes apply to agents created afterwards. Issued manifests are never modified.
- A retired installation cannot create agents. A database trigger enforces this even under a
  race. An unchanged retry of an already completed creation request still replays its original
  result.
- Every write records a before/after event in `organization_change_events`.

## Adding a role

Add skills, tools, workflows, a blueprint and its evaluation suite as data, then add the
entries to `packages/catalog/src/index.ts`. No platform code changes are needed. The Frontend
Engineer (Phase G, ADR 0015) was the first proof. The Backend Engineer, Code Reviewer and
Test Automation Engineer followed as data only (ADR 0019). A test checks that platform code
names no catalog role, workflow or suite outside legacy QA compatibility.

Change a released role only by adding a new version. Shared skills change the same way: the
new roles pin `change-scoping` and `change-proposal` 1.1.0, while released roles keep 1.0.0.

### Evaluation suites

Every role version names a suite (`evaluations.suite`) for that role. `npm run test:evals` runs
every scenario on every version it applies to, through the real control plane, agent runtime
and execution runtime with a scripted model. A scenario lists tool calls and, for each call,
what must happen:

| Expectation     | Meaning                                                                        |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SUCCEEDED`     | The tool ran; `contains` checks its output                                     |
| `FAILED` + code | The tool returned that error, for example `ACTION_DENIED` out of scope         |
| `NOT_AVAILABLE` | The role is not granted the tool                                               |
| `approval`      | The call pauses for this governed action; the evaluator approves or rejects it |

The scenario also names the tools the model must be offered, the final run status, and the
control-plane actions that executed (reached an external system). Commands, installs and
browser runs are recorded, not executed: these are governance evaluations, not model-quality
evaluations.

### Model-quality tasks

A suite may also hold `qualityTasks` (ADR 0020). A real model works each one unscripted,
through the same platform and simulated world, then the run is graded:

- **Checks**, deterministic, on successful tool calls, executed actions and the run status.
  A `required` check is a gate; every built-in task is gated on no denials and a completed
  run.
- **Rubric** criteria, scored from 0 to 1 by a grader model that must answer through one
  validated tool call. The transcript is passed as untrusted data.
- The weighted score must reach the task's `passThreshold`.

Each task names the approvals the evaluator grants (all others are rejected), simulated
results for commands and browser runs, and a turn and token budget. Run them with:

```bash
AF_QUALITY_MODEL=<model> AF_QUALITY_JUDGE_MODEL=<grader model> AF_QUALITY_MAX_TOKENS=2000000 AF_MODEL_API_KEY_ANTHROPIC=<key> npm run eval:quality
```

Settings can also live in the repository's `.env`. Optional settings:

- `AF_QUALITY_TRIALS`, the number of runs per task (default 1, at most 10);
- `AF_QUALITY_PRICE_PER_MTOK="<input>,<output>"`, US dollars per million tokens, for a cost
  estimate;
- `AF_QUALITY_REPORT_DIR`, where the reports go (default `.data/quality-reports`);
- `AF_EVALUATION_ROLE` and `AF_QUALITY_TASK`, filters.

The run fails closed without a model, a grader model, a credential or a total token budget,
and stops calling models once the budget is spent. It writes JSON and Markdown reports and
fails if a task does not pass. It never runs in `npm run check`; offline tests cover the
runner with scripted models.

#### Scores over time

The **Model quality** workflow (`.github/workflows/quality.yml`, ADR 0025) runs the live
evaluation every Monday at 06:00 UTC, and on demand with a chosen number of trials. It is
skipped until the repository is configured:

- variables `AF_QUALITY_MODEL`, `AF_QUALITY_JUDGE_MODEL` and `AF_QUALITY_MAX_TOKENS`, and
  optionally `AF_QUALITY_TRIALS` (default 3), `AF_QUALITY_PROVIDER` and
  `AF_QUALITY_PRICE_PER_MTOK`;
- the secret `AF_MODEL_API_KEY_ANTHROPIC`.

Each run adds its scores to a history carried from run to run as the `quality-history`
artifact. It then compares every series (model, grader, role version and task) with its
previous three runs. The job summary shows a trend table, and the workflow fails when a
series regresses. To do the same locally:

```bash
npm run eval:quality:trend --workspace @agents-foundry/control-plane-api -- --history .data/quality-history.jsonl --reports .data/quality-reports
```

To show the results to administrators (ADR 0026), download the latest `quality-history`
artifact and import it into the control plane. Runs already imported are skipped, so the same
growing file can be imported after every run:

```bash
npm run db:import-quality -- /absolute/path/to/quality-history.jsonl
```

It needs `DATABASE_URL` and `DATABASE_PLATFORM_URL`. The admin console's **Model quality**
panel then shows each model's trend per role task, and `GET /api/catalog/v1/quality` returns
the same data.

A new governed action still needs a policy-engine decision, and a new capability (a connector
or an execution operation) needs platform support first, by design.
