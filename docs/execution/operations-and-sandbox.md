# Workspace operations and sandbox guarantees

**Audience:** Operators, developers, security reviewers. **Implementation status:** Partially Implemented.

**Prerequisites:** Read the platform overview and have access to the relevant organization or source checkout.

The execution runtime is a separate process that runs workspace operations for agent runs:
repository checkout, git status, file reads and writes, project scripts and Playwright tests. It acts only on
control-plane-signed, single-use execution grants
([ADR 0007](../adr/0007-separate-execution-runtime.md),
[ADR 0013](../adr/0013-execution-grants.md)).

## Flow

```text
agent runtime tool (repository / browser)
  ├─ POST /runtime/v1/actions   {parameters: <operation>, inputDigest}   → ALLOWED | APPROVAL_REQUIRED | DENIED
  │     scope: checkout = configured repository, playwright = configured QA origin
  ├─ (approval, resume)
  ├─ POST /runtime/v1/actions/grant {requestId}                            → signed grant (≤ 10 min)
  └─ POST <execution-runtime>/execution/v1/operations {grant, operation}
        verify signature, expiry and operation digest → use grant once → run in the
        (org, employee, agent, thread) workspace → store evidence → {result, output, artifacts}
```

## Operations

| Operation              | Governed by                      | Tool           | Notes                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `git.checkout`         | `repository.read`                | `repository`   | Shallow clone of a branch or tag into a new workspace subdirectory; configured repository only; private repositories through a credential lease (below)                             |
| `git.status`           | `repository.read`                | `repository`   | `git status --porcelain=v1 --branch`                                                                                                                                                |
| `file.read`            | `repository.read`                | `repository`   | Text only, capped at 256 KiB; the path must stay inside the workspace after resolving symlinks                                                                                      |
| `playwright.run`       | `qa.execute_playwright`          | `browser`      | Runs the project's installed `@playwright/test` with a JSON reporter against the configured QA origin; requires approval                                                            |
| `file.write`           | `repository.write`               | `code-editor`  | Phase G. Inline UTF-8 content, at most 128 KiB; the deepest existing ancestor must resolve inside the workspace, and links are never written through                                |
| `command`              | `workspace.command`              | `build`        | Phase G. Only `npm run <script>` for the agent's configured `projectScripts`; network `NONE`; container provider only                                                               |
| `dependencies.install` | `workspace.dependencies.install` | `dependencies` | `npm ci --ignore-scripts` from the agent's configured `packageRegistryUrl` only, behind the egress proxy; container provider only ([ADR 0017](../adr/0017-dependency-installation.md)) |

## Private repositories

See [ADR 0031](../adr/0031-secret-and-credential-brokering.md).

```text
control plane: grant for git.checkout of a repository a source-control connection allows
  └─ creates a credential lease (5 minutes, one use) and names it in the signed grant
execution runtime, on receiving that grant:
  ├─ POST /runtime/v1/credentials/redeem {leaseId, grant}   signed with its own identity
  │     → the credential, once, if the lease, grant, run and connection all still hold
  ├─ git clone through the egress proxy, credential as a header to that repository only
  └─ POST /runtime/v1/credentials/release {leaseId, grantId, outcome}
```

- The agent runtime and the model never receive a credential, only the grant.
- The credential is given to `git` through the child process environment. It is never in the
  remote URL, `.git/config`, a credential helper, the command line, output or an artifact.
- Every HTTPS checkout leaves through the egress proxy, limited to the grant's hosts.
  Redirects are not followed.
- Submodules are never fetched.
- A failed, timed-out or cancelled checkout is removed. After a crash, the next start removes
  the partial checkout, releases the lease and closes the grant (`OPERATION_INTERRUPTED`).
- Without an execution identity, a grant that names a lease fails with
  `CREDENTIALS_UNAVAILABLE`; it never falls back to an anonymous clone.

## Local provider guarantees

| Enforced                                                                                    | Not enforced (documented, never assumed) |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Workspace path confinement (lexically, then after resolving symlinks)                       | CPU and memory limits                    |
| Argument lists, never a shell                                                               | Process-count limit                      |
| Scrubbed environment: private HOME and TMP, empty git config, no inherited secrets          | General host-process network isolation (HTTPS git uses a constrained proxy)                |
| Wall-clock timeout that kills the process tree; capped output                               |                                          |
| git hooks, credential helpers and templates disabled; `file://` repositories off by default |                                          |

Because of the right-hand column, the local provider reports `isolation: 'local'`. Agents
whose manifest requires `sandboxed` (the QA Engineer does) are refused
(`ISOLATION_UNAVAILABLE`) unless `EXECUTION_ALLOW_UNSANDBOXED=true` is set. Set that only for
development.

## Container provider (Phase G)

`EXECUTION_PROVIDER=container` selects `ContainerExecutionProvider` (`isolation: sandboxed`,
[ADR 0015](../adr/0015-frontend-engineer-and-sandboxed-execution.md)).

| Where                    | Operations                                              | Enforced                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Container (`docker run`) | `command`, `playwright.run` (all repository code)       | No capabilities, `no-new-privileges`, read-only root filesystem with a private `/tmp`, the grant's CPU, memory and process limits, `--pull never`, the workspace as the only mount, only the variables the provider sets, `--network none` for grants without hosts, an egress proxy for grants with hosts, and timeouts that remove the container |
| Host (local provider)    | `git.checkout`, `git.status`, `file.read`, `file.write` | Everything in the local provider table; these run no repository code; HTTPS checkout uses a constrained in-process proxy, while host execution is not container-isolated                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Executables are allow-listed (`npm` by default). Images must already be present.

### Egress proxy

Grants that need network (Playwright against a QA environment) run behind an egress proxy
([ADR 0016](../adr/0016-egress-proxy.md)):

- The sandbox joins a private `--internal` network created for the operation, so it has no
  route out.
- The network's only other member is a locked-down proxy container
  (`sandbox/egress-proxy.mjs`). It forwards `CONNECT` tunnels and plain HTTP to the grant's
  exact hostnames and nothing else.
- The proxy resolves names itself and refuses loopback, link-local (cloud metadata),
  unspecified and multicast addresses.
- Clients reach it through `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`. A client that ignores them cannot
  connect at all.
- Every decision is stored as an `egress.log` artifact, and blocked hosts are reported to the
  model.
- The sandbox, proxy and network are removed after each operation.

With `EXECUTION_EGRESS_PROXY=false`, such grants are refused (`EGRESS_CONTROL_UNAVAILABLE`)
unless `EXECUTION_ALLOW_UNRESTRICTED_EGRESS=true` runs them on the bridge network with no
allow-list.

npm run dev:runtime     # agent runtime with EXECUTION_RUNTIME_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4500
```

## Browser evidence

`playwright.run` keeps more than the report
([ADR 0037](../adr/0037-direct-artifact-upload-and-browser-evidence.md)): a trace for each failed
test, screenshots and videos the project produced, the test process's console output and, with
the container provider, the egress log as network evidence. Each kind has a size and count
limit and a retention class; anything over a limit is left out and the result says so.
Artifacts over 4 MiB are uploaded directly to the artifact store with a permission for exactly
those bytes.

## Restarts

At startup the runtime closes every grant the previous process was working under with
`OPERATION_INTERRUPTED`, discards unfinished credentialed checkouts and releases their leases
([ADR 0036](../adr/0036-failure-drills-and-reconciliation.md)).

## Limitations

- Egress is allow-listed by hostname only: any port on an allowed host is reachable, and TLS
  is not intercepted. Real Chromium through the proxy is covered only by an opt-in check
  (`AF_PLAYWRIGHT_CHECK=1 npx vitest run test/playwright-egress.spec.ts` in
  `apps/execution-runtime`), because it needs a Playwright image and the public npm registry.
- Grants allow 64 processes and threads; `qa.execute_playwright` allows 256, because
  Chromium crashes under 64.
- Dependency installation is npm only (`npm ci`, install scripts disabled), from one
  configured registry without credentials. Packages that need install scripts do not work.
- Checkouts are of branches or tags, not commit SHAs, over HTTPS only. Private repositories
  need a GitHub or Bitbucket source-control connection.
- Submodules are not fetched.
- `git.checkout` runs on the host. Its network is limited by the egress proxy, not by a
  container.
- Shell commands are never granted; only allow-listed `npm run` scripts are.
- If the execution runtime crashes mid-operation, the grant can't be reused. The action must
  be requested again. Only credentialed checkouts are cleaned up at the next start.
